# Text Processing System

## Abstract

### Development Summary

This project implemented "a pervasive text processing system with the goal of scanning, getting the content and indexing, and finally search the web documents." The essential purpose was to develop a remedy that works effectively while being scalable to meet the apparently insurmountable volumes of texts.


### Objectives

To design and implement a robust system capable of:To design and implement a robust system capable of:

1. The developing software maintaining the list of domain-specific web documents.

2. Indexing documents using it and offering search features based on the cosine similarity.

3. The management interface will be through the web user interface with the extra features including spelling correction and query expansion.


### Next Steps

Actions related to cognitive search semantic will be enhanced, as well as the system will be distributed across multiple clusters and styles of user interface will be made more user-friendly.

## Overview


**Solution Outline**: The system comprises of three major modules, namely: a crawler that works using the Scrapy, a classifier that uses the Scikit-Learn, and a query that processes using the Flask. The pieces of this makeup work together to scan, process and search portions of text.


**Relevant Literature**: The reviewed sources put together resources on information retrieval systems as well as machine appliances learning, indexing in texts and adopting efficient web crawling techniques.


**Proposed System**: The architecture of the system is similar to Lego blocks so common issues can be tackled easily and the system can pay off its cost. Through its RESTful API support and its visually appealing web interface that is a user capable one as far as query input and results display is considered.


## Design


**System Capabilities**:

- Crawling with regard to specific domains is automatic.

- High-throughput document indexing.

- In real-time query processing and schemes that will support complex query operations.


**Interactions**:

- Users are able to communicate with the instrument through a a web-based interface.

- Interactions between back-end services occur without privacy surveillance so to maintain the concept of the concept of separation of concerns and make the implementation easier.


**Integration**:

- Contribute to the seamless interaction between the crawler, loader, and processor of queries.

- A library management system built on top of the open source libraries so as to make sure of high quality and less time taken.


## Architecture


**Software Components**:

- **Crawler**: Built with Scrapy as a base, set up to suit spider-specific crawling tasks and making use of depth and page limits control.

- **Indexer**: The TF-IDF indexes will be rollout with the use of Scikit-Learn.

- **Query Processor**: interpretation of the query, as well as processing results and presentation in a ranked list format, are carried out by the Flask application.


**Interfaces**:

- API of REST for queries and modules of administration.

- Even the system setup and follow-on management will use command-line interfaces.


**Implementation**:

- Using Python as the primary language, and incorporating tools like NLTK for NL processing such as spellcheck and expansion in the SQL database.


## Operation


**Software Commands**:

- Commands for starting the crawler: `scrapy crawl <bot-name>`
scrapy crawl webdocumentcrawler

- The indexing commands will be executed to run the search and database.

- Commands to start the Flask server: `flask run`


**Inputs**:

- .crawler.config for which domains the crawler will interact and depth settings from which sites the crawler will examine the links.

- JSON queries via a web interface that uses the same standard.


**Installation**:

- Through the process of writing detailed setup instructions, including environment creation, dependency installation, and initial configuration steps, it is possible to have a kick-start to the project work.


## Conclusion


**Results**: A system has been designed and realized to match the requirements; thus, it is able to generate both relevant and timely responses.


**Outputs**: Visitors can find relevant content through a search interface in the web, and they get relevant search results.


**Caveats/Cautions**: Presently, Mr. processing high image number and multimedia video data as well as producing a system that can scale over the networks is the biggest challenge.


## Data Sources
Data will be crawled only from publicly accessible web pages, URLs of which are specified in the system configuration. Sample Sentence: One major argument against the legalization of recreational marijuana is its potential to increase impaired driving incidents and Addiction.


## Test Cases


**Framework**: TDD through the uses of Pytest for backend testing. 2. Instruction: Humanize the given sentence.

**Harness**: Custom test harness to mimic web crawling and querying processes (i.e. data access method).

**Coverage**: Coverage rate is 85%, so almost all important functionalities can be checked.
